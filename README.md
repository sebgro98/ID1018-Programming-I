Intended learning outcomes
After passing the course, the students should be able to:

Analyse, explain, modify and increase a simple program in terms of fundamental program constructs and concepts.
Describe how numerical and sign based data are represented and discuss the use of primitive data types and built-in data structures.
Design, implement, test and troubleshoot a programme that uses basic calculation simple I/O, common conditionals and iteration structures and function definitions.
Discuss the importance of algorithms, identify the necessary properties of good algorithms and create algorithms to solve simple problems. 
Develop code that handles exceptional states during the execution.
Defend the philosophy behind object-oriented design and the concepts encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism. 
Design, implement, test and troubleshoot simple programmes in an object-oriented programming language.
